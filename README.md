## Project Overview

This repository contains data (also accessible via ESS-DIVE) and modeling workflows for analyzing hyporheic sediment respiration using the **WHONDRS S19S** dataset. The project combines mechanistic process modeling with **knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML)** to evaluate how organic matter chemistry, microbial biomass, and physical substrate accessibility regulate realized respiration rates across river corridors.

This repository contains data products, preprocessing scripts, and modeling workflows used to analyze controls on sediment respiration using a combination of process-based understanding and machine learning.
